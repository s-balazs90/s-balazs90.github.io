        <p>Would I Lie to You? (abbreviated as WILTY) is a British comedy panel show aired on BBC One, made by Zeppotron
            for the BBC. It was first broadcast on 16 June 2007, starring David Mitchell and Lee Mack as team captains.
            The show was originally presented by Angus Deayton, and since 2009 has been hosted by Rob Brydon.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The show was presented by Angus Deayton in 2007 and 2008, with Rob Brydon (who had appeared as a guest
            panellist in the second series) taking over as host in 2009.[2] Throughout the entire run of the show, the
            team captains have been comedians David Mitchell and Lee Mack. Alan Carr was a team captain in the pilot but
            subsequently turned down an offer to appear on later shows.[3][better source needed]

            The first series was recorded at Fountain Studios in Wembley during March and April 2007 and aired at 21:55
            between 16 June and 28 July 2007 on BBC One (missing a week for coverage of the Concert for Diana memorial
            event). Filming for the second series took place between 15 November and 18 December 2007. The second series
            was filmed at BBC Television Centre in White City, West London, because Fountain Studios were being used for
            The X Factor. The second series aired at 21:00 between 11 July 2008 and 29 August 2008 on BBC One, and
            contained eight shows, an increase of two from series one. A compilation episode featuring some previously
            unaired material was aired on 19 September 2008 at 21:30 on BBC One.[4]

            Filming of a third series of eight episodes took place at Pinewood Studios during March and April 2009, and
            was broadcast between 10 August 2009 and 29 September 2009 on BBC One at 22:35. A compilation episode was
            also recorded. The airdate was 17 December 2009, due to the addition of Match of the Day to the BBC One
            schedule. Filming of a fourth series of eight episodes took place at Pinewood Studios again during April and
            May 2010, and was broadcast between 23 July 2010 and 10 September 2010 on BBC One at 22:35. The compilation
            episode aired on 17 September 2010. The fifth series was filmed during March 2011 and started airing from 9
            September at 21:30.[5]

            The sixth series of the show was recorded in March 2012 and began its broadcast on 13 April 2012.[6] This
            series was aired in a pre-watershed slot, at 20:30, for the first time.[7] Series 16 aired on Fridays at
            20:00.</p>

        <h3>Format</h3>
        <p>For each show, two celebrity guests join each of the team captains. The teams compete as each player reveals
            unusual facts and embarrassing personal tales for the evaluation of the opposing team. Some of these are
            true, some are not, and it is the panellists' task to decide which is which.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Rounds</h3>
        <div id="rounds-grid">
            <div id="column-1">
                <h4>"Home Truths"</h4>
                <p>Panellists read out a statement about themselves, from a card which they have not
                    seen
                    prior to recording. The opposing team has to decide whether it is true or false by asking the
                    panellist
                    questions. Much of the comedy in this round derives from the holder of the card having to
                    improvise
                    answers under increasingly detailed questioning. The first series used all six panellists; from
                    the
                    second series onwards, the round tended to focus on the four guests. In series two a
                    'possessions'
                    element was introduced, in which the panellist takes an item out of a box and reads a statement
                    from a
                    card, and has to convince the opposing team that the possession genuinely belongs to them.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="column-2">
                <h4>"This is My"</h4>
                <p>
                    A guest comes onto the set and is introduced by first name, but remains standing in
                    silence as the round continues. Panellists on one team tell the opposing team about their
                    relationship
                    to the guest; only one account out of three told is genuine, and the opposing team has to work out
                    which
                    it is. At the end of the round, the guest reveals their true identity, and with which of the
                    panellists
                    they have a genuine relationship.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="column-3">
                <h4>"Quick-Fire Lies"</h4>
                <p>
                    The second questioning round, with the panellists chosen at random. In earlier
                    series, the panellists were ostensibly under a time limit although no on-screen indicator of the
                    time
                    limit was ever present. The notion of a time limit was eventually dropped in the later series,
                    making
                    the round identical to "Home Truths" in practice. This round usually features - but is not exclusive
                    to
                    - Mitchell and Mack. From the fourth series onwards, Brydon also became an occasional participant,
                    with
                    both teams questioning him at once.
                </p>

            <div id="column-4">
                <h4>Former rounds</h4>
                <p>"Ring of Truth": A celebrity fact is read out by the host, and each team has to reach a joint
                    decision on whether it is true or false. This round was generally edited out of the fourth series;
                    as of
                    series five, it is no longer being played.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Telly Tales": Clips from a TV show are shown, a statement is read out about the show by a member of
                    one
                    team and the other team has to guess whether it is true or false. This round was only played in the
                    first series.
